# 🌐 boon416.github.io

This is my very first project and also my entry point into frontend development. I created this site as a personal playground to explore HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. It’s hosted using GitHub Pages.

## 📁 Project Structure

Inside the `Project` folder, you'll find two small sub-projects:

### 🔢 Counter
A mini timer tool built for *Honor of Kings* (王者荣耀) to help players keep track of red/blue buff respawn timings.

### 🏫 YLEdu
A demo website made for a tuition center near my home. It showcases a basic educational site layout with multiple sections.

## 💡 Motivation

This site holds sentimental value — it's the very beginning of my web development journey. I learned how to:
- Structure a website using HTML
- Style pages with CSS
- Add interactivity with JavaScript
